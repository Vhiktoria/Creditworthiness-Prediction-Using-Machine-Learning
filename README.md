# Creditworthiness Prediction Using Machine Learning

This capstone project predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to be approved or not, based on their financial and demographic data. It demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation and presentation.

## Objective
To help financial institutions make smarter lending decisions by identifying patterns that separate good borrowers from risky ones.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning & exploration
- Feature engineering (e.g., debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-term ratio)
- Handling class imbalance (class weights & SMOTE)
- Model training and evaluation (Recall, Precision, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
- Interpretation using feature importance and recall scores

## Final Model
We selected **Logistic Regression** due to its high recall score, which aligns with our project goal of identifying risky applicants correctly.

### This project was completed as part of a capstone under the Inspire Hope Initiative program. I'm now open to internship and entry-level roles in data science or analysis.
